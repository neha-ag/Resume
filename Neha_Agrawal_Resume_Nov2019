Senior Systems Software Engineer                                                                                     Nov 2014 – Oct 2017
*  OTA Software Development and Architecture – Autonomous Driving
       -      Over the Air Update for Nvidia’s Drive Platform
Helped design, architect and develop the entire OTA tool, to enable developers update their platform without connecting to the PC. Added provision for full or partial system update including firmware update for various configurations involving Native Linux, Hypervisor and Linux VM’s. The tool worked closely with flashing and image generation tool to develop OTA packages for release builds. Its main features were
- generate OTA packages for various configs with appropriate metadata and package name 
- publish it on the server hosting the OTA packages and maintain version information
- download, validate and install the update after booting in recovery boot-chain.
             This greatly helped reduce the development and testing time for developers to test their changes on top of                   
              trunk release builds.
  * Flashing - Nvidia’s Drive Platform ** 
-	Bootburn - Helped updating the flashing tool to support parallel flash, flash recovery images, generate config files for additional platforms for various configurations involving Native linux as well Hypervisor configurations supporting 1or 2 VM’s
-	Flashing Kernel - Involved in Flashing kernel update
* Tablet Software Development – Android **
-	Platform Power Measurement Lead for Nvidia’s 1st Shield Table ST8
-	Developed and scripted various use-cases for automated power measurement through an in-house power measurement tool Powersnap. Used it to generate power reports for several use-cases for every release build which gave the management a good view of power usage in various scenarios, bechmarks and identify regressions if any.
-	Profiled Sleep behavior and analyzed suspend, resume and active times power usage, identified top LP0 wake time consumers and got them fixed reducing the suspend/resume times. Saved 135mW of CPU wake power by lowering CPU frequency within agreeable limits. Helped bring down wifi ping wake power, direct touch power regression – touch boost, and GPU power during powered off charging.
-	Developed a Wakelock Monitor Design to analyze the wakelocks held during battery drain issues reported by beta testers for Nvidia’s Shield Tablet. It registered with Android Power Management services and batterystats services to collect the logs and then parsed the relevant info and visualized the data using Kibana Elastic search tool. This gave a good view of real-world power usage as compared to controlled in-house power measurement and identify and resolve several issues involving battery drainage.

   * System Software Development, Windows on Arm  - 1st Shield Tablet Win8 on Tegra 3 **
-	Designed and developed HID miniport KMDF keyboard driver for matrix keyboard controller supporting upto maximum 8 simultaneous key presses with various hot key supports.
-	Wrote HID KMDF Multi-Touch drivers supporting gestures for Windows-based tablets.
-	Developed board independent power management driver (PMIC) having generic interrupt handling, SPB op-region support, Voltage scaling to enable DVFS through PEP, interaction with I2C and GPIO drivers to support register reads/writes through I2C and power management of switches.
-	PIC for GPIO driver, driving and implementing Power Management requirements from the customer e.g. bank save/restore context during LP0 for Active/Idle Power Management. Support for ActiveBoth, level and long press interrupts.Enabling power management in GPIO driver.
-	Modified a sample bus driver to enumerate Generic Mobile broadband Adaptor driver. This involved creating a PDO of MBIM device and using IRP preprocessing functions to handle USB IOCTLS for submitting various configuration URBS with data obtained from traces of off-soc functional modem.
-	Understanding Hardware schematics, voltage stitching, power states and pin-muxing for T20 and T30 platforms
-	Understanding ACPI specs to enable i2c and gpio resources for drivers and adding custom ASL methods.
-	Experienced a shipping cycle of the software for WinRT release having 3 complete drivers (PMU, GPIO, 
-	Keyboard) and Connected Standby wake source handling.
